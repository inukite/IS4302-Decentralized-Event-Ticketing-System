IS4302 Decentralized Event Ticketing System
### Decentralised Event Ticketing System
Build a DApp for event ticketing where tickets are issued as ticket contracts. This system would prevent ticketing fraud and reduce scalping, as the origin and transfer history of each ticket can be transparently tracked.
### Purpose
To create a fairer and more transparent event ticketing industry, preventing fraudulent tickets and reducing speculative scalping, while offering true fans a better chance of getting a hold of their desired concert tickets.
